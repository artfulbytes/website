## Background
A popular sports in robotics is [robot-sumo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot-sumo) and similar to
regular sumo wrestling, there are two competitors trying to push each other out of a ring (dohyo), but instead of hefty
men from Asia, the two competitors are robots called sumobots.

There are many classes you can compete in, among the most popular are:
* Standard: 20cm x 20cm x 3kg
* Mini: 10cm x 10cm x 500g
* Micro: 5cm x 5cm x 100g

Besides giving rise to a competition, a sumobot is a great project for learning about robotics
and embedded systems development. It involves the typical parts of a robot (microcontroller, sensors, motors, and battery), and on top of that, you must implement an autonomous driving strategy.

## Features
* Mini-class (10cm x 10cm x 500g)
* Microcontroller MSP430
* Bare-metal C
* Custom PCB
* Four motors/wheels with skid-steering
* 3D-printed chassis

The [hardware design](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_hardware) and [software](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_software) are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/artfulbytes).
