[A video about interrupts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-daLDfkoyY).

I explain how microcontroller interrupts work by mixing theory with a code example. For fun, I let ChatGPT generate my code example. I also add some functions in my project that lets me add new GPIO interrupts more easily. Finally, I bump the clock speed of my microcontroller from 1 MHz to 16 MHz, not because I need to, but because I can.
