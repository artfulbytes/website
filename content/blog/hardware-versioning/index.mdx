In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doWyKt5NU8A), I show how I handle two different hardware targets (robot and development board) sharing the same software. First at compile time and then at runtime.

The video resulted in three new commits, which can be viewed in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_video).
