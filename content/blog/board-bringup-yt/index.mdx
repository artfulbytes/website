In [this video](https://youtu.be/Lqg3o8HR8uo), I explain and demonstrate board bring-up by doing a "fake" bring-up of the PCB on my actual robot. To verify the hardware, I run the code I've developed using the development board throughout this video series. While at it, I also fix some issues I discovered in earlier videos.

Board bring-up is an important stage of developing an embedded system. The goal is to verify (asap) that the untested hardware works as intended, because if it doesn't, it has to be fixed, so that new boards can be ordered.
