I released another [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9KbXJydf8I&t=1s).

In this one, I introduce a project series that will focus on programming a sumobot (embedded system) from scratch in the programming language C, including drivers for common peripherals like GPIO, UART, ADC, I2C, Timers, and more.

With this series, I aim to show what embedded systems programming might look like in the context of a project, which is different from the typical one-off tutorial because you have to consider more aspects when writing the code.
