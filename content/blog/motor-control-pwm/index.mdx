In [this video](https://youtu.be/G0wUN4As9NY), I write C code to control four brushed DC motors using two motor drivers (TB6612FNG) and a microcontroller (MSP430). Each motor driver requires two control inputs and one pulse-width modulation (PWM) input. I create three abstraction layers: a PWM driver at the bottom, a motor driver in the middle, and a simplified drive interface at the top. 21 videos in and something is finally moving.
