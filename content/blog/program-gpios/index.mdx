import Gist from "react-gist"

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inQODPSve-I), I program the I/O-pins
on my robot (and development board) according to the pin assignment in my schematic. Writing to registers
is cumbersome, so to make things easier, I implement a code abstraction in C that lets me configure and
initialize all pins in a single place.

The video resulted in three new commits, which can be viewed in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_video).
