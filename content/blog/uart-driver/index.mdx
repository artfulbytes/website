In [this video](https://youtu.be/wC9a0IkPA1A), I explain what UART is and show how I use it to print text from my microcontroller to my desktop computer. I first implement a UART driver based on polling and then improve on it by making it interrupt-driven with a ring buffer. This driver will serve as the foundation for when I implement printf in my next video.
