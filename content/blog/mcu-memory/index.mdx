In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyIEUCIVhQQ),

I explain how microcontroller memory works with a code example. I use my IDE's memory browser to see where different variables end up in memory, and I demonstrate two command line tools to track how much flash memory my code occupies. Overall, knowing how memory works is important because microcontrollers have a limited amount of it, and if we are not mindful of how we write our code, we may run out of it.
