I set up a simple continuous integration (CI) / continuous delivery (CD) pipeline using GitHub actions. Its job is to automatically build and analyse my code every time I push a new commit to GitHub. I create a docker image to hold the cross-toolchain (msp430-gcc) that I'm using to build the code for my target. the msp430 microcontroller. With this solution, the toolchain is always available in the GitHub action, and I don't have to worry about it breaking at some later point.
