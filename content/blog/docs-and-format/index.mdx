[The 11th video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qACpJi_x4dI) in the video series.

I thought I was ready to start writing code, but I had a few more things to discuss first.
In this video, I talk about the documentation (README.md), coding guidelines, code formatting of the project.
I also solve two bugs I ran into while writing code for the coming videos. The first bug was that the Makefile
didn't track the header files, and the second that cppcheck took a long time to execute.
