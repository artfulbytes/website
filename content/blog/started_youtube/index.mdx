I did it. I published [my first YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIQ3WB1GOW3tDRuzIGp4xRA) on a channel where I plan to make practical videos about embedded systems. The first videos will revolve around my sumobot project, and then I will see where it takes me.

By the way, I've also had [Instagram](https://instagram.com/artfulbytescom) since a while back.
