There are two common ways to set up a development environment for a microcontroller (embedded) project:

IDE - Use the integrated development environment (IDE) provided by the vendor.
CLI - Use the toolchain from the command-line (CLI), build with make (Makefile), and use your code editor of choice.

In the last video, I focused on the first approach and set up an IDE, Code Composer Studio (CCStudio). In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCfq44NNBaU), I focus on the second approach. I talk about toolchains, the advantages of building from the command-line, and show how to install a GCC-based toolchain and use it to compile the same blink LED project (MSP430) as in the last video. Finally, I create a Makefile from scratch to make building easier.

I re-use the blink project, but I broke out some of the LED functionality into separate files to make it into multi-file project. The Makefile is basic, but can serve as a good starting point for any microcontroller project.

I previously made a [blog post](./makefile-microcontroller) covering similar things.

I talk about compiler flags, and I recommend [this blog post](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/best-and-worst-gcc-clang-compiler-flags) from interrupt memfault.

See [tools page](/devenv) for more info about my Linux setup.
