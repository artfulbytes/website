Since understanding the hardware is a big part of programming an embedded system, I'm beginning my [embedded programming series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9KbXJydf8I&list=PLS_iNJJVTtiRV0DZRDcTHnvAuDrKGPN40) by talking about the hardware. In [the latest video](https://youtu.be/XGXvntPHA9M), I show the hardware block diagram

and discuss the parts and why I picked them, including:
* [Motor driver (TB6612FNG)](https://www.digikey.se/en/products/detail/toshiba-semiconductor-and-storage/TB6612FNGC8EL/1730134)
* [Motors (400RPM@6V)](https://www.jsumo.com/core-dc-motor-6v-400-rpm)
* [Range sensor (VL53L0X)](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l0x.html)
* [Line sensor (QRE1113)](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9453)
* [Battery (7.4 V LIPO)](https://www.amazon.se/Makerfire-LiPo-batteri-intelligent-Quadcopter-reservdelar/dp/B07M9T66WV)
* [Microcontroller (MSP430G2553)](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP430G2ET)

In the next video, I will continue with the hardware by doing a walkthrough of the PCB design.
