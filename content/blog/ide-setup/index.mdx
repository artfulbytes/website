There are two common ways to set up a development environment for a microcontroller (embedded) project:

IDE - Use the integrated development environment (IDE) provided by the vendor.
CLI - Use the toolchain from the command-line (CLI), build with make (Makefile), and use your code editor of choice.

The first is the most straightforward way and is what I demonstrate in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1HToCzku9Y). I show how to set up Code Composer Studio (CCStudio), the IDE that TI provides for their microcontrollers. I install it on Linux and get the Blink LED example program to run on the evaluation board (MSP430 Launchpad). In the next video, I will demonstrate the second way, which is the one I prefer.

See [tools page](/devenv) for more info about my Linux setup.
