[Another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24ajcWSfdaY) in my project series.

I demonstrate cppcheck, which is a static analyser for C/C++. I show how to enable and suppress errors, and create a Makefile-rule that lets me run "make cppcheck" from the command-line to check my entire project.

[This](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_video) is the repository that I commit to in the video series.


Example 1:
```
cppcheck --quiet --enable=all --error-exitcode=1 main.c file1.c src/ -I include/
```

Example 2 (suppress specific error):
```
cppcheck --quiet --enable=all --error-exitcode=1 --suppress=unusedFunction:main.c:1
```
