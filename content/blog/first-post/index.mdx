## First failure

I failed the first test of discipline as a developer starting a blog:

"Don't build your own site".

**Why shouldn't you build your own site?** Because it's a project in itself. It's procrastination.
It's better to create good content.

I built my own site because I don't like WordPress, and I have
shit-talked it too much to use it. I also tell myself I will be better of in the
long run building my own site as I'm going to want to customize it more as I find
my groove, and WordPress quickly turns into a plugin nightmare. I don't want that.
I want my site to be more like a garden that I can tend to.

## Gatsby is great
Looking for alternatives to WordPress, I quickly settled for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static site generator built on top of the Javascript library ReactJS. In contrast to WordPress, where each page is generated by a server-side upon request, Gatsby generates
all pages at build time. This means you can serve the Gatsby output as is without the need for server-side rendering and a database.

The main benefits of a static site is speed, security, cheap hosting, and SEO.
Gatsby in particular, has many plugins, starters and templates, which makes it easy to quickly get going.

Gatsby is not as easy as WordPress because you do need to know how to code. I had to familiarize myself with ReactJS, which took some time, but after getting past the initial learning curve, I must say I like Gatsby. The plugins are great, and it's easy to customize the parts you don't like, which is exactly what I'm after.

## What I do
Web development is not what I normally do, what I want to do, or what this blog will be about.

I work with embedded systems.

**What's an embedded system?**

The typical definition goes something like: "A combination of hardware and software with a specific purpose, often embedded in a larger system".

As an embedded systems engineer at Hasselblad, I work with digital cameras. A digital camera may not seem like much on the surface, but the amount of complexity in a modern digital camera is astonishing. This is often the case for embedded systems, a seemingly simple device that packs an entire universe of functionality on the inside. which is one reason this field captivates me.

Programming an embedded system is different from programming a desktop or web application. When developing an embedded system, we are fighting to make it cheap, fast, small, power-efficient, secure, and so on. All of these aspects puts limitations on the hardware, which in turn puts limitations on the software. These limitations requires us to work at a lower level, e.g. C, C++, and the occasional assembly, to squeeze the most out of the hardware.

## Web developers are ahead
By diving into web development, I was again reminded of how different it is from embedded development. I was struck by how thriving their online community is and the abundance of high-quality online content. This makes the entire field very approachable. Whereas the embedded community sometimes seems to be stuck in the middle ages - the online content is scarcer and less comprehensible.

**Why are these two fields so different?**

One major reason is that in web development you don't have to deal with the complexity of hardware, but I think there are some other reasons as well.

There are many more web developers than embedded developers, and it's natural for their community to thrive on the medium they are building. The web industry moves fast, and new web technologies are constantly on the rise, and it's a field with a big emphasis on how things look. Consequently, it attracts adaptive and artistically minded people, both important ingredients for creating attractive content online.

In contrast, the embedded industry moves slower, and much of it has looked the same for decades. It's an industry that lends itself to those with long experience, that is, the battle-scarred veterans, who care more about how things work than how they look and are less well-versed in the modern mediums.

Of course, boards like Arduino and Raspberry PI, and companies like Adafruit and Sparkfun have made it easier to get started. However, there is still a big difference between what they teach you and what a professional embedded engineer does. Plugging in a pre-made kit and writing a few lines of Cython doesn't
cut it in a real product.

## What content do I want to create?
This brings me to the kind of content I want to create, which is content that better reflects what a professional embedded engineer does.

My current idea is to create content around my own projects because I think projects are the best way to demonstrate what embedded development is about. It would allow me to show the entire process of creating an embedded system, including the hardware and
software. Projects are also what I personally enjoy the most, and this won't last if I don't do what I enjoy.

Exactly how I will go about it will evolve, but I think a key to making
embedded systems approachable and exciting is to modernize the content on it, and I will do my best to take inspiration from all the great content creators in other fields.

It's a big goal for someone with a few years of experience, but there is also an advantage to that - I'm less prone to the [Curse of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge):
the difficulty in grasping what it's like for others not to know something
you know. Finally, this is as much about teaching myself as it is about teaching others.

## What about the name?
I stole the name from a book on my shelf: *Artful Sentences* written by Virginia Tufte. It contains a collection of beautiful sentences along with Tufte's insightful commentary.
I want to talk about Embedded systems just as Tufte talks about writing, but my focus won't be on sentences. It will be on code, which is made up of bytes (not far-fetched at all).
