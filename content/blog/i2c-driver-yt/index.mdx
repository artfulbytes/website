[New video](https://youtu.be/yZGWpDTbjdw).

My sumobot has five range sensors (VL53L0X) to detect the sumobot enemy. In this video, I write an I2C driver to talk to these sensors and verify the traffic with a logic analyzer. I also add an existing driver on top as well as a software layer (enemy) for a nicer application interface.
