In [this video](https://youtu.be/K7eHkij-wNY), I develop a simple driver to decode the signal between an IR remote and my robot. The square-like signal follows the NEC protocol, which I decode by detecting the edges through GPIO interrupts, and measure the time between them using the microcontroller's timer peripheral.
