During development, I tend to add scratch functions to test a particular part of the code. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndwA_YX3VYM), I try to handle these functions in a less ugly way.

As always, the code is available in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/artfulbytes/nsumo_video).
